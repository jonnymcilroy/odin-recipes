        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its creamy, rich sauce made from eggs, 
            cheese, pancetta, and black pepper. Traditionally prepared with spaghetti, the hot pasta is 
            tossed with the raw egg mixture, which creates a velvety sauce without the need for cream. 
            The pancetta adds a savory, smoky flavor that perfectly complements the creamy texture, while 
            freshly ground black pepper adds a subtle kick. Carbonara is loved for its simple ingredients and bold, 
            comforting flavors, making it a popular and satisfying choice for pasta lovers.
