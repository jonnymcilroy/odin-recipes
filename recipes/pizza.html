        Tortilla pizza is a quick and easy dish where a tortilla serves as a thin, crispy crust.
        It’s made by topping a large tortilla with sauce, cheese, and various toppings, then baking
        or pan-frying until the edges are golden and the cheese is melted. This simple, versatile recipe
        is perfect for a personal-sized pizza that cooks in minutes, making it a convenient option for busy
        days or casual meals. Tortilla pizzas can be customized with favorite ingredients, from classic pepperoni
        and veggies to more creative options like pesto and fresh herbs.
