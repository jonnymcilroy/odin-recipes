        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish that has become beloved worldwide for its comforting layers of flavor and hearty texture. 
            Traditionally, it consists of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with rich fillings, including a meaty tomato-based sauce, a creamy 
            béchamel or ricotta layer, and a blend of cheeses such as mozzarella and Parmesan. These layers are carefully stacked and baked together, 
            creating a bubbling, golden top that gives way to a savory, melt-in-your-mouth interior. The contrast of the robust sauce, creamy cheeses, 
            and tender pasta makes lasagna a satisfying meal perfect for gatherings, family dinners, or special occasions.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond the classic meat-based lasagna, variations abound, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences. 
            Vegetarian lasagnas often incorporate roasted vegetables, spinach, mushrooms, or even butternut squash, bringing a unique depth
            of flavor and texture to the dish. There are also vegan adaptations, using dairy-free cheeses and plant-based meat alternatives. 
            In every version, lasagna embodies the essence of Italian comfort food, offering a warm, layered experience that’s adaptable, flavorful, 
            and deeply satisfying. Its enduring popularity speaks to its versatility and the way it brings people together around a shared table.
