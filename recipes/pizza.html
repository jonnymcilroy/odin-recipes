        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tortilla pizza is a quick and easy dish where a tortilla serves as a thin, crispy crust. 
            Itâ€™s made by topping a large tortilla with sauce, cheese, and various toppings, then baking 
            or pan-frying until the edges are golden and the cheese is melted. This simple, versatile recipe 
            is perfect for a personal-sized pizza that cooks in minutes, making it a convenient option for busy 
            days or casual meals. Tortilla pizzas can be customized with favorite ingredients, from classic pepperoni 
            and veggies to more creative options like pesto and fresh herbs.
